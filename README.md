# Redesign: YouTube

## How to start the application 
1. npm install
2. npm start
3. Navigate to http://localhost:3000

## Design case
I choose YouTube to redesign because its a web app that I use in daily basis and I always have struggle when I choose to engage with
the community for example comments and I generally forget to Subscribe and notice the content creator has to constatntly remind the viewers to subscribe to their channel. 

Also, I noticed Google Suite products are updating their UI hence I wanted to implement modern UI which will align YouTube with Google Ecosystem. 


### Areas of Improvement

1. Make the UI Modern similar look and feel with other Google Suite products
2. Bring attention to Subscribe button by adding animation.
3. Add hove effects to Like/Dislike buttons for more engagement.
4. Move the comments to the right tab in Video Streaming view, which makes it easier for used to scroll through the comments. 

### Design Approach

1. I took inspiration from existing Google Suite products UI Design.
2. Discovered and Researched more areas for improvement for YouTube UI. 
3. Shortlisted the places to improve. 
4. Coded the layout with HTML/CSS and JS with animations.
5. Converted markup to React Components and built the app using react-create-app 
6. Bug Fixes (Responsive, setTimeout animation)

### Improvements / Next Steps
0. Add clean comments
1. Remove inline styles
2. Add 404 SVG animation for videos not found
3. Write test cases for UI Components
4. Break the UI into smaller components
5. Use Real YouTube API to fetch data
6. Write BEM for CSS and use CSS preprocessors (LESS, SASS)
7. Add Dark Mode 
8. Browser Compatibility testing and css fix


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
